      <p>
        Greetings! I'm Rachel Harris, a seasoned Software Developer based in
        Perth with over a decade of tech experience. Currently at Culture Amp, I
        focus on enhancing our React and Ruby on Rails apps with new features
        and smooth functionality while also developing new applications to
        bolster our digital toolkit. Beyond coding, I delve into frontend
        development with React/Typescript, optimize Ruby on Rails APIs, and
        refine our AWS infrastructure, always striving for efficient, automated
        solutions. Collaboration is key, as I work closely with Product Managers
        and Designers to ensure our solutions meet expectations. With a
        background ranging from Delivery Lead to Product Manager at MYOB and
        currently studying a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I'm
        committed to crafting impactful software experiences that transcend mere
        lines of code.
